Octopress is a framework built on top of Jekyll. It's a static site generator which means that it lacks advance feature which would normally require scripting and a back-end like Wordpress. If you want to know whether you should switch to Octopress or would like to know some tweaks, tips or adjustments then continue through this post.

## Why To Migrate From Wordpress
* WORDPRESS TO MANY FEATURES
* SECURITY OF WP VS STATIC (TARGET SPAM< HACKS)
* MARKDOWN
* THEME ETC, READY FROM THE GET GO
 
 ## Features You Might Miss
* You canâ€™t edit online from anywhere. With Wordpress a mobile app was available so you did not need to be at your computer/laptop to publish new posts.
* Yay Markdown. Shame there is no solid way to manipulate images except by hand. I have currently worked aroud this by using Picasa to host my images which will cache my images and resize my images.
* NO DRAFTS / PREVIEW / PUBLISHING.
* LIMITED THEMES AND PLUGINS
* When you publish a post the publication date, by default is the date you created it, not when you published it.
* SLOW PREVIEW LARGE POST
* NO COMMENT SYSTEM, TALK MIGRATION. USE EXTERNAL
* THEME SYSTEM IS BETTER
